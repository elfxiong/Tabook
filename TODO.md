# TODO

    - remove authenticator from db
- user registration (3 layers)
- making reservation (3 layers)
- check duplicated username when creating users
- front end login form validation (may hash the password in form.save())
- prevent duplicated authenticator for the same user (caused by login before logout)
- login status
    - test check_authenticator code
    - show username on top right corner (to indicate the user is logged in)
